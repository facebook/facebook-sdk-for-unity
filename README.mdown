SETUP DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONTMENT IN MAC
-------------
Since Unity decided to change the way in which each of the versions was installed in the Mac file system, Unity Hub, and also due to changes in the distribution of implementations in the DLL from version 2019, it is necessary to solve the dependencies references in the project depending on the installed version.
-For this, this process has been automated through a script ./configure.sh that is in the root of the project. You should run this script before opening the Facebook.sln project.

You can use an interactive mode, this mode tries to find the unity versions installed on your system and will ask you which version to use.

```
run ./configure.sh
```
Or you can input a version directly as parameter

```
run ./configure.sh 2021.1.17f1
```

Usage:
./configure.sh
or
./configure.sh [Unity version]
Unity version: Exactly full definition as it appears. Ex: 2017.4.40f1, 2018.4.36f1, 2021.1.17f1

Examples:
./configure.sh                     <- Interactive
./configure.sh 2021.1.17f1         <- Use 2021.1.17f1 version
./configure.sh 2018.4.36f1         <- Use 2018.4.36f1 version

You can run the script as many times as you need, it can even be useful to jump from one version to another quickly and check that the compilation is correct.

BUILDING THE SDK
-------------

```
./scripts/setup.sh
